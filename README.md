__🗺️ Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) – TurtleBot Simulation__

This repository contains a simulation project demonstrating Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using the TurtleBot (Turtle Burger) robot in a custom Gazebo environment.
The robot performs real-time mapping and localization inside the simulated world, showcasing how SLAM enables autonomous navigation in an unknown environment.
